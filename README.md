> A [visual novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel), often abbreviated as **VN**, is a form of digital semi-interactive fiction. Visual novels are often associated with and used in the medium of video games, but are not always labeled as such themselves. They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity.

## Why Visual Novels

Like many others, I was affected by the global events since 2020, which led to endless doomscrolling through depressing news, developing various neuroses and eventually a severe [panic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder). I underwent treatment at a clinic for some time, took potent drugs, and attended consultations for my mental health. Despite trying various medications, relaxation techniques, and contemporary methods from specialized literature, nothing helped me as much as visual novels did. Yes, I'm serious.

VNs offer a truly unique experience where you can deeply connect with your character even more than in virtual reality. This is a highly personal and indescribable experience that is challenging to put into words. It's important to note that I don't view visual novels as dating sims or anything like that. Rather, I consider them a distinct art form that effectively promotes mental health and encourages innovative thinking. Moreover, top visual novel titles can make an equally strong impression as the best movies, TV series, or books. As you know, the problem of poor content is growing every year, but visual novels offer a refreshing addition to the world of entertainment.

## My Top Picks

The items in the list are arranged based on the impact they had on me, from the strongest to the weakest. Please note that this selection only features visual novels that I've completed at least one ending for. It's normal if your opinions differ from mine.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note for Steam Deck users:** most of the visual novels in this list require `GE-Proton` to ensure proper in-game video playback on SteamOS. Without it, you may encounter codec errors or playback issues. Please follow [this guide][GE-Proton Guide] for installation instructions.

- Tips from [Claude Sonnet](https://claude.ai)

> *Why are only visual novels for Android and Steam Deck listed here?*

I strongly believe that a visual novel cannot be considered awesome if it cannot be run on portable devices. In this day and age, Android and Steam Deck are the most popular portable platforms. Older VNs should be able to run successfully using emulators, and new ones should be developed with portable support right from the start. Visual novel developers who artificially limit the range of supported platforms show a lack of respect towards their readers. Personally, I'm not comfortable reading VNs while sitting at my computer after a long day of work.

> *Why is my favorite visual novel not on this list yet?*

I only read visual novels that can be played on Android or Steam Deck. Additionally, I prefer to read works in my native language, Russian. I have also come across titles that I cannot recommend for various reasons, and therefore, have not included them in my list.

> *What if a visual novel is not translated into my language or is not available in my country?*

These are very common scenarios. I frequently face these issues when searching for Russian translations of visual novels. Fortunately, you can often find an **unofficial patch** for your language on [vndb.org][vndb.org list sorted by rating] - this is the go-to resource for such cases.

> *How can I install an unofficial patch on Android?*

Typically, you will need to download an unofficial APK file and manually transfer it to your Android device using a USB cable or wirelessly via [AirDroid](https://web.airdroid.com/). In some cases, after installing the APK, you may also need to manually copy game cache files to folders such as `android/data` or `android/obb`. The exact installation steps can vary from game to game, so be sure to follow the installation guide provided by the unofficial patch author.

> *How can I install an unofficial patch on Steam Deck?*

For most visual novels, you will need to install `Bottles` using the `Discover` app. Once installed, create a new "bottle" - essentially an environment where you can run your games. Then, either run the unofficial patch installer or manually copy the game files into this bottle. Finally, add your non-Steam game to the launcher and apply the `Keyboard (WASD) and Mouse` button layout to enable controller support for your visual novel. For detailed installation instructions, please follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/wbyilj/guide_installing_windows_gamesmodslauncher_on/).

> *Why do some videos from visual novels not work on a Steam Deck?*

When you play visual novels on a Steam Deck, you may experience video codec errors, video skipping, or even see a "test pattern" placeholder instead of actual video playback. This issue occurs because the standard Proton version from Valve lacks certain proprietary video codecs that many visual novels rely on. Fortunately, the solution is straightforward: you need to install `GE-Proton` (a community-enhanced version of Proton) via `ProtonUp-Qt`, which is available in the `Discover` app, and then apply it to your game. For detailed installation instructions, please follow [this guide][GE-Proton Guide].
