> A [visual novel], often abbreviated as **VN**, is a form of digital semi-interactive fiction. Visual novels are often associated with and used in the medium of video games, but are not always labeled as such themselves. They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity.

## Why Visual Novels?

I'm sure you're aware of the global events that have been unfolding since 2020, which have affected everyone, including myself. It all started with endless doomscrolling through depressing news, developing various neuroses and uncontrolled aggression, eventually leading to a severe [panic disorder]. I underwent treatment at a clinic for some time, took potent drugs, and attended consultations for my mental health. Despite trying various medications, relaxation techniques, and contemporary methods from specialized literature, nothing helped me as much as visual novels did. Yes, I'm serious.

VNs offer a truly unique experience where you can deeply connect with your character even more than in virtual reality. This is a highly personal and indescribable experience that is challenging to put into words. It's important to note that I don't view visual novels as dating sims or anything like that. Rather, I consider them a distinct art form that effectively promotes mental health and encourages innovative thinking. Moreover, top visual novel titles can make an equally strong impression as the best movies, TV series, or books. As you know, the problem of poor content is growing every year, but visual novels offer a refreshing addition to the world of entertainment.

- Tips from my friends

> *Why are only visual novels for Android and Steam Deck listed here?*

I strongly believe that a visual novel cannot be considered awesome if it cannot be run on portable devices. In this day and age, Android and Steam Deck are the most popular portable platforms. Older VNs should be able to run successfully using emulators, and new ones should be developed with portable support right from the start. Visual novel developers who artificially limit the range of supported platforms show a lack of respect towards their readers. Personally, I'm not comfortable reading VNs while sitting at my computer after a long day of work.

> *Why is my favorite visual novel not on this list yet?*

I only read visual novels that can be played on Android or Steam Deck. Additionally, I prefer to read works in my native language, Russian. I have also come across titles that I cannot recommend for various reasons, and therefore, have not included them in my list.
