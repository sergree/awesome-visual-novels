> A [visual novel], often abbreviated as **VN**, is a form of digital semi-interactive fiction. Visual novels are often associated with and used in the medium of video games, but are not always labeled as such themselves. They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity.

## Why Visual Novels?

I'm sure you're aware of the global events that have been unfolding since 2020, which have affected everyone, including myself. It all started with endless doomscrolling through depressing news, developing various neuroses and uncontrolled aggression, eventually leading to a severe [panic disorder]. I underwent treatment at a clinic for some time, took potent drugs, and attended consultations for my mental health. Despite trying various medications, relaxation techniques, and contemporary methods from specialized literature, nothing helped me as much as visual novels did. Yes, I'm serious.

VNs offer a truly unique experience where you can deeply connect with your character even more than in virtual reality. This is a highly personal and indescribable experience that is challenging to put into words. It's important to note that I don't view visual novels as dating sims or anything alike. Rather, I consider them a distinct art form that effectively promotes mental health and encourages innovative thinking. Moreover, top visual novel titles can make an equally strong impression as the best movies, TV series, or books. As you know, the problem of poor content is growing every year, but visual novels offer a refreshing addition to the world of entertainment.
