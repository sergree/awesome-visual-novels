# My Favorite Awesome Visual Novels Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! If you have any suggestions for visual novels that I should read next, please feel free to submit a pull request with edits to the [Next in Line](README.md) section. Please keep in mind that I only read visual novels on Android or Steam Deck and prefer those that are translated into Russian.

Use this ChatGPT query to shorten descriptions of visual novels:
